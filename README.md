# Computational Physics Portfolio
This portfolio is collection of projects that I completed during my time taking Computational Physics at High Point University.

It contains 4 mini-projects and 1 final project covering a variety of scientific ideas and investigations. They are all written in some form of python in jupyter notebook.

Project 1: üî¨ üî¥ 
Project 1 is an investigation in how gravity affects the density of an ideal gas in a box. The gas molecules collide with each other but not the box itself so think of the box as merley a "slice" of an overall concentration of an ideal gas.

Project 2: ‚ôæÔ∏è üì°
Project 2's pupose is to examine the difference of Classical and Relativitic Motion ODEs. We will do this by applying a constant force on two identical particles using the two different methods and comparing/contrasting the results.

Project 3: üìà
Project 3 is a building block to what end up being my final project of the semester. This project models the flight of a golf ball on a 2d plane with spin and magnus effect.

Project 4: ‚ùî
Project 4 is an investigation of coupled oscillators and how their initial parameters change the fundamental frequency. The parameters tested are number of masses, effective stiffness, and total mass of the system.

Final Project: ‚õ≥   üïπÔ∏è
My final project is a golf ball flight simulator. This simulator includes 3d flight projection using vpython that uses project 3 as a starting point. This project adds in 3d motion, sidespin, spin decay, and wind.
